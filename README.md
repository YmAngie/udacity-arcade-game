frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

This is a Final Project for [Object-Oriented JavaScript course by Hack Reactor at Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015). So the game wasn't built from scratch and was based on the materials from the Udacity [repository](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game). 

## Game instructions
--------------------

1. **How to run the game**
- Download the code or clone the repository.
- Open an `index.html` file in your favourite browser.
2. **How to play the game**
- Add a number of enemies you'd like to compete with.
- Use ←, →, ↑, ↓ keys on the keyboard to move the player.
- You should gain the water row and avoid collisions with your enemy-bugs.
- Getting hit by the enemy will cause score reduce and gaining the water row will increase it.

    ### Good luck! :)
